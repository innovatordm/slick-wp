Slick by Ken Wheeler as WordPress-plugin


Package of http://kenwheeler.github.io/slick/ as a WordPress-plugin.

Just download 'dist', rename it to 'slick-wp' and upload to your plugins folder. 


Add "data-slick" as attribute to activate

<code>
&lt;div data-slick&gt; &lt;div&gt;Slide #1&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt;Slide #2&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
</code>

Additional options passed to .slick() can be added as data-<option-name>. The whole $.data() is passed to the constructor except for the data-slick.
